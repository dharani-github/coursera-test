                             A roasted chicken is one of the essential recipes I encourage every cook to learn and master. It is my favorite way to prepare a whole chicken.

Having a roast chicken recipe tucked in your back pocket is one of the secrets you learn to master your home kitchen.

Change up the spices, seasonings and herbs and you have a different dish every night of the week.

Roast a whole chicken for leftovers. The extra can make their way into all sorts of dishes from salads to sandwiches. Once you picked all the meat, save the bones and toss it into a stock or soup.

The pan juices and drippings are the beginnings of a great sauce or gravy to keep your roast chicken recipe interesting and delicious.

If you don’t already have a great roasted chicken recipe of your own or are looking to improve an old stand-by, I have a few pointers to help you along.

HERE IS WHAT I DO TO GUARANTEE A PERFECT ROASTED CHICKEN:

SEASON IT WITH SALT

This one seems obvious. The moment you venture into the kitchen, the first thing you learn is to season. What isn’t obvious is when you need to season.

Before you roast your chicken, season it with salt the night before. At least 8 hours if you want to get this part in before you head off to work.

Salting your chicken generously inside and out before you roast it will help season your chicken all the way through. You’ll end up with a flavorful chicken from skin to wishbone.

The same way brining your chicken keeps it moist, salting it beforehand achieves that same juicy result.

The amount you need isn’t exact. It will depend on the size and where you source your chicken. A little less than a teaspoon of salt per pound of chicken is a good place to start. Adjust it from there based on the chicken you use.

It may be more a little more salt than you’re use to using, but give it some time and you’ll see.

Patience is always rewarded in the kitchen

LEARN TO TRUSS

A whole chicken has a very unsightly appearance when it’s just laid out on your counter. Legs sprawled out and the wings dancing in the air. For that same reason, it’s terrible to roast a chicken in that state.

The wing tips will burn. The breast pieces will dry out. The final product just won’t be appetizing at all.

That’s where trussing comes in.

Trussing is a technique where you tie your chicken with string to create a compact appearance and size. Create a uniform shape and size before the roasting and you’ll be treated to an evenly cooked finale.

Trussing chicken is traditionally done with string. String is messy and makes more trash. I have a way of doing it without the need for string.

Watch me demonstrate how easy it is to truss a chicken without string.

HAVE FUN

Here’s where why I love roasting chicken: anything can happen at this point.

I can transform this chicken into anything I want with different herbs, spices and seasonings.

I can use my favorite go-tos.

Brush it all over with clarified butter and sprinkle a good pinch of Herbs de Provence all over. Crack some black pepper and tuck a few cloves of garlic under the skin.

Or I can stuff the cavity with lemon, garlic and parsley. Perfume it from the inside out. Rub it with some olive oil infused with lemon, peppercorn, garlic, and bay leaves right before it goes into the oven.

Every roast chicken can be different and that is why I love making it.

Just remember to hold off on any extra salt if you followed my first tip. Your chicken should be seasoned well enough at this point.

GIVE IT SOME SPACE

Your roast chicken should appear from the oven enrobed in a layer of perfectly crispy chicken skin.

If this isn’t your favorite part of a roasted chicken, you have not had a perfect roasted chicken. For that, I am seriously sorry.

You’ll want a few things on your side to help make this culinary trasnformation for yourself.

A hot oven for one. I like to roast in the 425–450 range. Remember to use your thermometers. You will need one for the oven and one for the chicken.

Make sure your chicken has room for air to circulate around it.

I like roasting it on a roasting rack or a cooling rack over a roasting pan right in the middle of the oven. A cup of water or chicken broth in the bottom will help keep any grease from smoking up your kitchen. Save whatever you collect from the bottom. You can make a sauce, gravy or just drizzle it over your chicken later.

And remember before you season your chicken, pat it dry and use some kind of grease, fat or oil on the outside of the chicken. This step helps coax the skin to brown and fry to a golden, crispy crunch.

LEARN CHICKEN DIVISION

Your roasted chicken has finished. It’s cooked to the perfect temperature. You pull it out of the oven. It looks mighty tasty. You leave it to rest and let the juices redistribute.

While you are waiting for the chicken to rest, you need to learn how to carve a chicken.

Dividing the chicken into neat, indidivual pieces is a gift to yourself.

Have a picky diner that insist on just legs? Effortless slice through the line that connects the leg and the thigh.

A table full of friends who all want a piece of white meat? Seamlessly carve the breast back from the bone. Serve nice little slices, with a sliver of crispy skin for all.

Learning how to divide your chicken however you need to suit yourself or your guest is how you elevate a simple weeknight meal to an elegant date night toasting wine on the balcony.

You’ll mess up a few times, but it’s a special touch to perfect your recipe.


Learning how to roast a whole chicken, gives back to you in the kitchen in infinite ways.

It becomes a lifesaver you’ll lean on when you’re having a hectic week. It’s a centerpiece when you’re hosting the in-laws for dinner. It’s a welcomed gift to a neighbor who could use a home cooked meal right now.

My tips for roasting the perfect chicken will have you forgetting about those $5 warehouse club chickens. Your roasted chicken will turn out more flavorful and juicy. And who can forget about that beautifully rendered crisp of chicken skin. Don’t be surprised if you end up roasting a chicken at least once a week just for that part.

A perfect roasted chicken will be your most trusted and tried recipe. It is simple to prepare and well loved by everyone.
